# Description of your program (part 7)
To count the words, you can create an index counter of the number of spaces in the document. IN order to do that, first open the file. Then create a variable as 0 and then iterate through every character and when there is a space, the variable will increase by one. After iterating through the full document, the variable will come out to the number of words in the document.

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
It was kind of intuitive to figure out a pattern to initialize a variable to count the spaces but it was kind of difficult to describe because I haven't coded in almost two years so I forgot a lot of the code language and how to aptly describe my steps. It is also hard to try to be as specific as possible because I wasn't sure if my directions would make sense to other people other than myself. 
I'm hoping to learn more and be more comfortable in coding and hopefully learn how to code websites and apps so I can create viable projects. I also hope to gain confidence in coding and spark an interest in coding.
